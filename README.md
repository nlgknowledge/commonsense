## The Commonsense Evaluation Card 
To facilitate reproducibility as well as understanding of the reported work, we have devised the Commonsense Evaluation Card (CEC) which offers authors a guide on how to report evaluations of commonsense-enhanced NLG systems. It can also be used for NLP systems with minor modifications.
You can find a CEC FORM at the following link [The Commonsense Evaluation Card FORM](https://nlgknowledge.github.io/commonsense/)
